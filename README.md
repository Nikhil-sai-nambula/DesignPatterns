## 📖 Overview

This repository documents my daily exploration of software design patterns. Each pattern is implemented in **Java** and accompanied by:

- **Code examples** with detailed comments
- **Notion documentation** explaining concepts, use cases, pros/cons, and UML diagrams
- **Real-world analogies** to solidify understanding

**Goal**: Master all design patterns and build a reusable reference for developers.
